 <i> <h3>  What is Happiness Index?</h3>

<p><i> Machine learning is a technology which allows a software program to became more accurate at pretending more
accurate results without being explicitly programmed and also ML algorithms uses historic data to predicts the new outputs.
Because of this ML gets a distinguish attention. Now a dayâ€™s prediction engine has become so popular that they are
generating accurate and affordable predictions just like a human, and being using industry to solve many of the problems.
Predicting justified salary for employee is always being a challenging job for an employer. In this paper and proposing a
salary prediction model with suitable algorithm using key features required to predict the salary of employee. </p>
  
  <br><br>
  
  <i> <h3> Problem Statement:</h3>

<p><i>To build a machine learning model and predict the salary of the employees based on year of experience</p>

<br>

<h3> Details of the Project </h3>

  <p> The Project is divided into three parts </p> <br>
<p> 1- Building a machine learning model to predict Employee Salary. </p> 
<p> 2. We build a web app on Flask to mount the prediction model. </p> 
<p> 3. We deploy the Flask project on Heroku through github. </p> 

<br> <br> <br>
  
 
<h3> Machine Learning Model </h3>

<p> So we start off with building a machine learning model using simple Linear Regression model and train that model using the Happiness index dataset. For this project you will also see StandardScaler in action and why we have implemented it also </p>
  <br> 
  
  <h3>Deploying on Heroku </h3>

<p> This is the last part where we will deploy the Django application on Heroku using the connections to github. </p>
