# Employee-Salary-Prediction-Using-ML

Machine learning is a technology which allows a software program to became more accurate at pretending more
accurate results without being explicitly programmed and also ML algorithms uses historic data to predicts the new outputs.
Because of this ML gets a distinguish attention. Now a day’s prediction engine has become so popular that they are
generating accurate and affordable predictions just like a human, and being using industry to solve many of the problems.
Predicting justified salary for employee is always being a challenging job for an employer. In this paper and proposing a
salary prediction model with suitable algorithm using key features required to predict the salary of employee.

Problem Statement:
To build a machine learning model and predict the salary of the employees based on year of experience


Dataset description
This dataset is randomly created to show you how we can use machine learning technique and build a Linear Regression model to predict the salary of an employee based on years of experience.
This dataset consists of two columns
Salary- Represent the salary of a person.
Years- Years of experience


Steps:-

Step 1: Load the Dataset.
Step 2: Split dataset into training set and test set.
Step 3: Fit Simple Linear Regression model to training set.
Step 4: Predict the test set.
Step 5 — Visualizing the training set.
Step 6 — Make new predictions.
